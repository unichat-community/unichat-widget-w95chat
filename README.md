> [!NOTE]
> Just like any other **UniChat** widget, this widget also works with sources originating from plugins (like kick through `plugin-kick`),
> but it was primarily made to work with native sources (YouTube and Twitch), so there may be limitations and/or unexpected behaviors when using plugin sources.
